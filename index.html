  <h1> Oasis</h1>
      <p>Oasis was a British rock band hailing from Manchester, England who dominated the 90's music scene. In a era strongly influenced by melancholy grunge, Oasis stood out as a beacon of highly energized positivity as they sang of life's indulges and their rockstar lifestyle. With over 20 platinum records and multiple award winning albums, it's no doubt that they'll go down in history as one of the greatest band ever.</p>
